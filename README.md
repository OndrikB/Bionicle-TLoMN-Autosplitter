# Bionicle-TLoMN-Autosplitter
Livesplit ASL Script for the Bionicle: The Legend of Mata Nui beta (or final) build (Also works for Rebuilt!)


This script can now split when:

-You pick up an item (you can select any item to split on, as long as it's not in water)

-You go to another area (you can turn this on or off!)

-You change levels (also toggleable!)



-Boss Rush mode is planned, currently does nothing
