# Bionicle-TLoMN-Autosplitter
Livesplit ASL Script for the Bionicle: The Legend of Mata Nui beta (or final) build
This script does not work for the beta

This script auto-splits whenever a play area is loading (even backtracking).
It also stops time when an area is loading and slows it down during conversations or cutscenes
